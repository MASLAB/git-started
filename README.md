## LEVEL 3

Great job passing Level 2!

As I mentioned before, management's identified a bug in `test.py` and they've created
this branch, `bugfix1973`, for you to fix it.  Go ahead and open up `test.py` in your
favorite text editor and take a look to see what the bug is... once you think you've
fixed the bug, go ahead and commit to this branch (`bugfix1973`).

Then, checkout to the `master` branch and *merge this branch into `master`*.
