## LEVEL 2

Congratulations!  You passed Level 1!

Unfortunately, `test.py` on the `master` branch has a little bug... :(

You can run `test.py` like this to see for yourself!

```
$ python3 test.py
```

Unfortunately, management doesn't want us to touch the `master` branch right now,
but they have created for us a new branch called `bugfix1973` to address the issue.

Go ahead and checkout to the `bugfix1973` branch.
